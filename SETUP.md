# ðŸš€ Supabase Setup Guide for Debtrix

This guide will walk you through setting up Supabase authentication and database for the Debtrix application.

## Step 1: Create Supabase Project

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Click "Start your project"
3. Sign in with GitHub (recommended)
4. Click "New Project"
5. Choose your organization
6. Fill in project details:
   - **Name**: `debtrix` (or your preferred name)
   - **Database Password**: Generate a strong password (save this!)
   - **Region**: Choose closest to your users
7. Click "Create new project"
8. Wait 2-3 minutes for setup to complete

## Step 2: Get Your API Keys

1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to **Settings** â†’ **API**
2. Copy the following values:
   - **Project URL** (looks like: `https://abcdefgh.supabase.co`)
   - **anon public** key (the long string under "Project API keys")

## Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

1. In your project root, create a `.env` file:
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
```

2. Replace the values with your actual Supabase URL and anon key

## Step 4: Set Up Database Schema

1. In Supabase dashboard, go to **SQL Editor**
2. Click "New query"
3. Copy the entire content from `supabase/migrations/20250614174953_misty_union.sql`
4. Paste it into the SQL editor
5. Click **Run** (or press Ctrl/Cmd + Enter)
6. You should see "Success. No rows returned" message

## Step 5: Configure Authentication

1. Go to **Authentication** â†’ **Settings**
2. Under **Site URL**, add your development URL: `http://localhost:3000`
3. Under **Redirect URLs**, add:
   - `http://localhost:3000/**`
   - `https://your-domain.netlify.app/**` (for production)

### Optional: Disable Email Confirmation (for testing)

1. Go to **Authentication** â†’ **Settings** â†’ **Email**
2. Turn off "Enable email confirmations"
3. This allows immediate login without email verification

## Step 6: Test Your Setup

1. Start your development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

2. Go to `http://localhost:3000`
3. Click "Sign Up" and create a test account
4. Check your Supabase dashboard:
   - Go to **Authentication** â†’ **Users** to see your new user
   - Go to **Table Editor** â†’ **profiles** to see the auto-created profile

## Step 7: Production Deployment

### For Netlify:

1. In your Netlify dashboard, go to **Site settings** â†’ **Environment variables**
2. Add the same environment variables:
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Your anon public key

3. Update your Supabase authentication settings:
   - Go to **Authentication** â†’ **Settings**
   - Add your production URL to **Redirect URLs**: `https://your-site.netlify.app/**`

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Supabase project created and fully initialized
- [ ] Environment variables configured in `.env`
- [ ] Database migration executed successfully
- [ ] Authentication settings configured
- [ ] Test user registration works
- [ ] Test user login works
- [ ] User profile automatically created in database
- [ ] Production environment variables set (if deploying)

## Troubleshooting

### "Missing Supabase environment variables"
- Check that your `.env` file exists in the project root
- Verify the variable names are exactly: `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- Restart your development server after adding environment variables

### "Invalid Supabase URL format"
- Ensure your URL starts with `https://` and ends with `.supabase.co`
- Don't include trailing slashes

### Authentication not working
- Verify your Supabase project is fully set up (not still initializing)
- Check that the database migration was run successfully
- Ensure authentication is enabled in Supabase dashboard

### Database errors
- Make sure you ran the complete migration file
- Check that all tables were created: `profiles`, `projects`, `ux_debts`
- Verify RLS (Row Level Security) is enabled on all tables

## Need Help?

If you're still having issues:

1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Check the Supabase dashboard logs
3. Verify all steps were completed in order
4. Try creating a fresh Supabase project if needed

The application should now be fully functional with real Supabase authentication and database integration!
